## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Bhavya!
Iâ€™m a sophomore at UMass Amherst, diving into the exciting worlds of Computer Science and Mathematics. My journey began with a fascination for solving puzzles and tackling complex problemsâ€”whether itâ€™s cracking codes or untangling intricate equations. This curiosity led me to blend my love for analytics and technology with a growing interest in consulting.

Iâ€™m passionate about finding data-driven solutions and turning them into actionable strategies. I thrive when Iâ€™m working alongside others, brainstorming ideas, and tackling challenges together. For me, thereâ€™s nothing quite like the thrill of collaborating on a project and seeing our collective efforts make a real impact.

As I look ahead, Iâ€™m eager to dive into internship opportunities where I can apply my skills in data analysis and business strategy. Iâ€™m excited about connecting with professionals who share my enthusiasm and learning from their experiences. Letâ€™s work together to solve problems and drive meaningful change!
