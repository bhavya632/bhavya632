### 🎶 Outside of Tech...

I love reading, listening to music, and cooking. Cooking is more than a hobby for me—it's a creative outlet that reminds me there are endless ways to approach the same challenge. Whether I'm following a recipe or improvising, I’ve learned to stay creative, keep experimenting, and embrace new perspectives—just like in tech and life!
